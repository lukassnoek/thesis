## Learning from the brain
When reading this thesis' title, some might think that it contains a typo. Scientists want to learn _about_ the brain, right? Not _from_ the brain. Well, yes, neuroscientists do. But I am a psychologist at heart, interested in human behavior, cognition, and above all, emotion. I'm interested in the mind, not the brain. I don't care about axons, neurotransmitters, and the basal ganglia. Sure, I do believe, like any proper scientist, that everything we feel, perceive, and do is instantiated in the brain, but I do not necessarily think that _just_ studying the brain in isolation is going to teach us anything useful about the human psyche. Mind you, in this PhD you'll find several studies that analyze _brain_ data, but realize that my ultimate goal has always been to understand the mind.
