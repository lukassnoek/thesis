_The first chapter of the thesis, which introduces your PhD project. The filler-text below was created with the [postmodernism generator](http://www.elsewhere.org/journal/pomo)._

---

Something about the coming about of this thesis. More of a "lessons learned" rather than a coherent research topic.

## The brain is not a dictionary
Something about looking at populations of neurons/voxels/areas rather than simple one-to-one relationships. Shared states.

## The brain (probably) does not care about your hypothesis
Facial expression models.

## Interpretability and prediction are a trade-off (for now)
A plea for prediction but a cautionary tale for interpreting predictive models (confounds)

## Exploration should be embraced more
Something about the "context of discovery" (cf. TCM), preregistration, and confirmation vs. exploration (Morbid curiosity.)

## Proper generalization is hard
Within and between subject variance is not noise, but unexplained variance (AU limitations).

## Psychology is complex, so it needs complex models
Which need to be fit on complex, large datasets. (AOMIC)
