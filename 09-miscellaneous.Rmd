Sometimes more chapters are added to the back matter, for instance:

* A short CV of the author
* A list of publications; (including) work that did not make it into the thesis (but that you've co-authored, for instance)
* A list of contributions to the chapters, in case they are based on multi-author papers

I've included the latter two in [my PhD thesis](https://lcreteig.github.io/thesis/), if you're looking for some inspiration.
