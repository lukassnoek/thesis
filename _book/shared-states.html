<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The present study tested whether the neural patterns that support imagining “performing an action”, “feeling a bodily sensation” or “being in a situation” are directly involved in understanding <em>other people’s</em> actions, bodily sensations and situations. Subjects imagined the content of short sentences describing emotional actions, interoceptive sensations and situations (self-focused task), and processed scenes and focused on <em>how</em> the target person was expressing an emotion, <em>what</em> this person was feeling, and <em>why</em> this person was feeling an emotion (other-focused task). Using a linear support vector machine classifier on brain-wide multi-voxel patterns, we accurately decoded each individual class in the self-focused task. When generalizing the classifier from the self-focused task to the other-focused task, we also accurately decoded whether subjects focused on the emotional actions, interoceptive sensations and situations of <em>others</em>. These results show that the neural patterns that underlie self-imagined experience are involved in understanding the experience of other people. This supports the theoretical assumption that the basic components of emotion experience and understanding share resources in the brain.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>To navigate the social world successfully it is crucial to understand other people. But how do people generate meaningful representations of other people’s actions, sensations, thoughts and emotions? The dominant view assumes that representations of other people’s experiences are supported by the same neural systems as those that are involved in generating experience in the self <span class="citation">(e.g., Gallese et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-gallese2004unifying" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>; see for an overview Singer, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-singer2012past" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. We tested this principle of self-other neural overlap directly, using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), across three different aspects of experience that are central to emotions: actions, sensations from the body and situational knowledge.</p>
<p>In recent years, evidence has accumulated that suggests a similarity between the neural patterns representing the self and others. For example, a great variety of studies have shown that observing actions and sensations in other people engages similar neural circuits as acting and feeling in the self <span class="citation">(see for an overview Bastiaansen et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-bastiaansen2009evidence" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>. Moreover, an extensive research program on pain has demonstrated an overlap between the experience of physical pain and the observation of pain in other people, utilizing both neuroimaging techniques <span class="citation">(e.g., Lamm et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-lamm2011meta" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> and analgesic interventions <span class="citation">(e.g., Rütgen et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-rutgen2015placebo" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Mischkowski et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-mischkowski2016painkiller" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. This process of “vicarious experience” or “simulation” is viewed as an important component of empathy <span class="citation">(Carr et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-carr2003neural" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Decety, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-decety2011dissecting" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; Keysers &amp; Gazzola, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-keysers2014dissociating" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. In addition, it is argued that mentalizing (e.g. understanding the mental states of other people) involves the same brain networks as those involved in self-generated thoughts <span class="citation">(Uddin et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-uddin2007self" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>; Waytz &amp; Mitchell, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-waytz2011two" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. Specifying this idea further, a constructionist view on emotion proposes that both emotion experience and interpersonal emotion understanding are produced by the same large-scale distributed brain networks that support the processing of sensorimotor, interoceptive and situationally relevant information <span class="citation">(Barrett &amp; Satpute, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-barrett2013large" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Oosterwijk &amp; Barrett, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-oosterwijk2014embodiment" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. An implication of these views is that the representation of self- and other-focused emotional actions, interoceptive sensations and situations overlap in the brain.</p>
<p>Although there is experimental and theoretical support for the idea of self-other neural overlap, the present study is the first to directly test this process using MVPA across three different aspects of experience (i.e. actions, interoceptive sensations and situational knowledge). Our experimental design consisted of two different tasks aimed at generating self- and other-focused representations with a relatively large weight given to either action information, interoceptive information or situational information.</p>
<p>In the <em>self-focused</em> emotion imagery task (SF-task) subjects imagined performing or experiencing actions (e.g., <em>pushing someone away</em>), interoceptive sensations (e.g., <em>increased heart rate</em>) and situations (e.g., <em>alone in a park at night</em>) associated with emotion. Previous research has demonstrated that processing linguistic descriptions of (emotional) actions and feeling states can result in neural patterns of activation associated with, respectively, the representation and generation of actions and internal states <span class="citation">(Oosterwijk et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-oosterwijk2015concepts" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Pulvermüller &amp; Fadiga, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-pulvermuller2010active" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. Furthermore, imagery-based inductions of emotion have been successfully used in the MRI scanner before <span class="citation">(Oosterwijk et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-oosterwijk2012states" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Wilson-Mendenhall et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-wilson2011grounding" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, and are seen as robust inducers of emotional experience <span class="citation">(Lench et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-lench2011discrete" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. In the <em>other-focused</em> emotion understanding task (OF-task), subjects viewed images of people in emotional situations and focused on actions (i.e., <em>How</em> does this person express his/her emotions?), interoceptive sensations (i.e., <em>What</em> does this person feel in his/her body) or the situation (i.e., <em>Why</em> does this person feel an emotion?). This task is based on previous research studying the neural basis of emotion oriented mentalizing <span class="citation">(Spunt &amp; Lieberman, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-spunt2012integrative" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>With MVPA, we examined to what extent the SF- and OF-task evoked similar neural patterns. MVPA allows researchers to assess whether the neural pattern associated with one set of experimental conditions can be used to distinguish between another set of experimental conditions. This relatively novel technique has been successfully applied to the field of social neuroscience in general <span class="citation">(e.g., Gilbert et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-gilbert2012evaluative" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Brosch et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-brosch2013implicit" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Parkinson et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-parkinson2014common" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>, and the field of self-other neural overlap in particular. For example, several MVPA studies recently assessed whether experiencing pain and observing pain in others involved similar neural patterns <span class="citation">(Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-corradi2016cross" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>; Krishnan et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-krishnan2016somatic" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. Although there is an ongoing discussion about the specifics of shared representation in pain based on these MVPA results <span class="citation">(see for an overview Zaki et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-zaki2016anatomy" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>, many authors emphasize the importance of this technique in the scientific study of self-other neural overlap <span class="citation">(e.g., Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-corradi2016cross" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>; Krishnan et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-krishnan2016somatic" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>MVPA is an analysis technique that decodes latent categories from fMRI data in terms of multi-voxel patterns of activity <span class="citation">(Norman et al., <a href="bibliography.html#ref-norman2006beyond" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>. This technique is particularly suited for our research question for several reasons. First of all, although univariate techniques can demonstrate that tasks activate the same brain regions, only MVPA can statistically test for shared representation <span class="citation">(Lamm &amp; Majdandžić, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-lamm2015role" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. We will evaluate whether multivariate brain patterns that distinguish between mental events in the SF-task can be used to distinguish, above chance level, between mental events in the OF-task. Second, MVPA analyses are particularly useful in research that is aimed at examining distributed representations <span class="citation">(Singer, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-singer2012past" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. Based on our constructionist framework, we indeed hypothesize that the neural patterns that will represent self- and other focused mental events are distributed across large-scale brain networks. To capture these distributed patterns, we used MVPA in combination with data-driven univariate feature selection on whole-brain voxel patterns, instead of limiting our analysis to specific regions-of-interest <span class="citation">(Haynes, <a href="bibliography.html#ref-haynes2015primer" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. And third, in contrast to univariate analyses that aggregate data across subjects, MVPA can be performed within-subjects and is thus able to incorporate individual variation in the representational content of multivariate brain patterns. In that aspect within-subject MVPA is sensitive to individual differences in how people imagine actions, sensations and situations, and how they understand others. In short, for our purpose to explicitly test the assumption that self and other focused processes share neural resources, MVPA is the designated method.</p>
<p>We tested the following two hypotheses. First, we tested whether we could classify <em>self-imagined</em> actions, interoceptive sensations and situations above chance level. Second, we tested whether the multivariate pattern underlying this classification could also be used to classify the how, what and why condition in the <em>other-focused</em> task.</p>

<div id="subjects" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Subjects</h3>
<p>In total, we tested 22 Dutch undergraduate students from the University of Amsterdam (14 females; M<sub>age</sub> = 21.48, s.d.<sub>age</sub> = 1.75). Of those 22 subjects, 13 subjects were tested twice in 2 sessions about 1 week apart. Half of those sessions were used for the model optimization procedure. The other half of the sessions, combined with an additional nine subjects (who were tested only once), constituted the model validation set (see Model optimization procedure section). In total, two subjects were excluded from the model validation dataset: one subject was excluded because there was not enough time to complete the experimental protocol and another subject was excluded due to excessive movement (&gt;3 mm within data acquisition runs).</p>
<p>All subjects signed informed consent prior to the experiment. The experiment was approved by the University of Amsterdam’s ethical review board. Subjects received 22.50 euro per session. Standard exclusion criteria regarding MRI safety were applied and people who were on psychopharmacological medication were excluded a priori.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.1</span> Self-focused emotion imagery task</h4>
<p>The self-focused emotion imagery task (SF-task) was created to preferentially elicit <em>self-focused</em> processing of action, interoceptive or situational information associated with emotion. Subjects processed short linguistic cues that described actions (e.g., <em>pushing someone away</em>; <em>making a fist</em>), interoceptive sensations (e.g., <em>being out of breath</em>; <em>an increased heart rate</em>), or situations (e.g., <em>alone in a park at night</em>; <em>being falsely accused</em>) and were instructed to imagine performing or experiencing the content. The complete instruction is presented in the Supplementary Materials; all stimuli used in the SF-task are presented in Supplementary Table S1. Linguistic cues were selected from a pilot study performed on an independent sample of subjects (<em>n</em> = 24). Details about this pilot study are available on request. The descriptions generated in this pilot study were used as qualitative input to create short sentences that described actions, sensations or situations that were associated with negative emotions, without including discrete emotion terms. The cues did not differ in number of words, nor in number of characters (<em>F</em> &lt; 1).</p>
