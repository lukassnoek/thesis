The filler-text below was created with the postmodernism generator. Something about the coming about of this thesis. More of a “lessons learned” rather than a coherent research topic. 2.1 The brain is not a dictionary Something about looking at populations of neurons/voxels/areas rather than simple one-to-one relationships. Shared states. 2.2 The brain does not care about your hypothesis Facial expression models. 2.3 Interpretability and prediction are a trade-off (for now) A plea for prediction but a cautionary tale for interpreting predictive models (confounds) 2.4 Exploration should be embraced more Something about the “context of discovery” (cf. TCM), preregistration, and confirmation vs. exploration (Morbid curiosity.) 2.5 Proper generalization is hard Within and between subject variance is not noise, but unexplained variance (AU limitations). 2.6 Psychology is complex, so it needs complex models Which need to be fit on complex, large datasets.
