Symbol,Dims.,Description
$N$,-,Number of samples (usually subjects or trials)
$K$,-,"Number of neuroimaging features (e.g., voxels or sensors)"
$P$,-,"Number of confound variables (e.g., age, reaction time, or brain size)"
$X_{ij}$,$N \times K$,"The neuroimaging patterns (often called the ""data"" in the current article), where the subescript $i \in {1 \dots N}$ refers to the individual samples (rows), and the subscript $j \in {1 \dots K}$ to individual features (columns)"
$y$,$N \times 1$,"The target variable (i.e., what is to be decoded)"
$C$,$N \times P$,The confound variable(s)
$\hat{\beta}$,$K + 1$,The parameters estimated in a general linear model (GLM)
$w$,$K + 1$,The parameters estimated in a decoding model
$r_{Cy}$,-,Sample Pearson correlation coefficient between $C$ and $y$
$r_{y(X.C)}$,-,"Sample semipartial Pearson correlation coefficient between $X$ and $y$, controlled for $C$"
$p(r_{Cy})$,-,$p$-value of sample Pearson correlation between $C$ and $y$
