  abstract  = "Imaging studies of cerebral volumes often adjust for factors
               such as age that may confound between-subject comparisons.
               However the use of nuisance covariates in imaging studies is
               inconsistent, which can make interpreting results across studies
               difficult. Using magnetic resonance images of 78 healthy
               controls we assessed the effects of age, gender, head size and
               scanner upgrade on region of interest (ROI) volumetry, cortical
               thickness and voxel-based morphometric (VBM) measures. We found
               numerous significant associations between these variables and
               volumetric measures: cerebral volumes and cortical thicknesses
               decreased with increasing age, men had larger volumes and
               smaller thicknesses than women, and increasing head size was
               associated with larger volumes. The relationships between most
               ROIs and head size volumes were non-linear. With age, gender,
               head size and upgrade in one model we found that volumes and
               thicknesses decreased with increasing age, women had larger
               volumes than men (VBM, whole-brain and white matter volumes),
               increasing head size was associated with larger volumes but not
               cortical thickness, and scanner upgrade had an effect on
               thickness and some volume measures. The effects of gender on
               cortical thickness when adjusting for head size, age and upgrade
               showed some non-significant effect (women>men), whereas the
               independent effect of head size showed little pattern. We
               conclude that age and head size should be considered in ROI
               volume studies, age, gender and upgrade should be considered for
               cortical thickness studies and all variables require
               consideration for VBM analyses. Division of all volumes by head
               size is unlikely to be adequate owing to their non-proportional

               brain function has led to their widespread adoption in the
               neurosciences. However, prior to the rise of multivariate
               decoding, the study of brain function was firmly embedded in a
               statistical philosophy grounded on univariate methods of data
               analysis. In this way, multivariate decoding for brain
               interpretation grew out of two established frameworks:
               multivariate decoding for predictions in real-world
               applications, and classical univariate analysis based on the
               study and interpretation of brain activation. We argue that this
               led to two confusions, one reflecting a mixture of multivariate
               decoding for prediction or interpretation, and the other a
               mixture of the conceptual and statistical philosophies
               underlying multivariate decoding and classical univariate
               analysis. Here we attempt to systematically disambiguate
               multivariate decoding for the study of brain function from the
               frameworks it grew out of. After elaborating these confusions

               strategies to help resolve these confusions in interpreting

              neural activation patterns that cannot be detected using
              classical mass-univariate analysis. Recently, Todd et al.
              (``Confounds in multivariate pattern analysis: Theory and rule
              representation case study'', 2013, NeuroImage 77: 157-165)
              highlighted a potential problem for these methods: high
              sensitivity to confounds at the level of individual participants
              due to the use of directionless summary statistics. Unlike
              traditional mass-univariate analyses where confounding activation
              differences in opposite directions tend to approximately average
              out at group level, group level MVPA results may be driven by any
              activation differences that can be discriminated in individual
              participants. In Todd et al.'s empirical data, factoring out
              differences in reaction time (RT) reduced a classifier's ability
              to distinguish patterns of activation pertaining to two task
              rules. This raises two significant questions for the field: to
              what extent have previous multivoxel discriminations in the
              literature been driven by RT differences, and by what methods
              should future studies take RT and other confounds into account?
              We build on the work of Todd et al. and compare two different
              approaches to remove the effect of RT in MVPA. We show that in
              our empirical data, in contrast to that of Todd et al., the
              effect of RT on rule decoding is negligible, and results were not
              affected by the specific details of RT modelling. We discuss the
              meaning of and sensitivity for confounds in traditional and
              multivoxel approaches to fMRI analysis. We observe that the
              increased sensitivity of MVPA comes at a price of reduced
              specificity, meaning that these methods in particular call for
              careful consideration of what differs between our conditions of
              interest. We conclude that the additional complexity of the
              experimental design, analysis and interpretation needed for MVPA

              attempted to predict personality traits from the ``Big Five'', as

              As a benchmark, we showed that we could replicate prior reports
              of predicting IQ from the same dataset. Best predictions in all
              cases were around r=0.2, thus only accounting for about 4\% of
              the variance. We conclude with a discussion of the potential for

               was outside the focus of attention, but nonetheless in STM, was
               retained in an active state. Here, we replicate and extend this
               finding by querying the neural signatures of attended versus
               unattended information within STM with electroencephalograpy
               (EEG), a method sensitive to oscillatory neural activity to
               which the previous fMRI study was insensitive. We demonstrate
               that in the delay-period EEG activity, there is information only
               about memory items that are also in the focus of attention.
               Information about items outside the focus of attention is not
               detectable. This result converges with the fMRI findings to
               suggest that, contrary to conventional wisdom, an active memory
               trace may be unnecessary for the short-term retention of

              of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most
              commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy
              (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract
              structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images
              in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain
              changes related to development, degeneration and disease.
              However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard
              registration algorithms; there has not to date been a
              satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images

  abstract  = "Representational similarity analysis of activation patterns has
               become an increasingly important tool for studying brain
               representations. The dissimilarity between two patterns is
               commonly quantified by the correlation distance or the accuracy
               of a linear classifier. However, there are many different ways
               to measure pattern dissimilarity and little is known about their
               relative reliability. Here, we compare the reliability of three
               classes of dissimilarity measure: classification accuracy,
               Euclidean/Mahalanobis distance, and Pearson correlation
               distance. Using simulations and four real functional magnetic
               resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, we demonstrate that
               continuous dissimilarity measures are substantially more
               reliable than the classification accuracy. The difference in
               reliability can be explained by two characteristics of
               classifiers: discretization and susceptibility of the
               discriminant function to shifts of the pattern ensemble between
               imaging runs. Reliability can be further improved through
               multivariate noise normalization for all measures. Finally,
               unlike conventional distance measures, crossvalidated distances
               provide unbiased estimates of pattern dissimilarity on a ratio
               scale, thus providing an interpretable zero point. Overall, our
               results indicate that the crossvalidated Mahalanobis distance is
               preferable to both the classification accuracy and the

               voxel-wise analysis, often with the goal of drawing different
               conclusions from each. Because MVPA results can be sensitive to
               latent multidimensional representations and processes whereas
               univariate voxel-wise analysis cannot, one conclusion that is
               often drawn when MVPA and univariate results differ is that the

               voxel-level variability in the effect of a condition within

              In a recent study (Carlson, 2014), we used an unbiased model of
              visual cortex to reveal a new source of decodable information
              that may account for orientation decoding. Clifford and Mannion

  abstract = "Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is a relatively recent
              innovation in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              methods. MVPA is increasingly widely used, as it is apparently
              more effective than classical general linear model analysis
              (GLMA) for detecting response patterns or representations that
              are distributed at a fine spatial scale. However, we demonstrate
              that widely used approaches to MVPA can systematically admit
              certain confounds that are appropriately eliminated by GLMA. Thus
              confounds rather than distributed representations may explain
              some cases in which MVPA produced positive results but GLMA did
              not. The issue is that it is common practice in MVPA to conduct
              group tests on single-subject summary statistics that discard the
              sign or direction of underlying effects, whereas GLMA group tests
              are conducted directly on single-subject effects themselves. We
              describe how this common MVPA practice undermines standard
              experiment design logic that is intended to control at the group
              level for certain types of confounds, such as time on task and
              individual differences. Furthermore, we note that a simple
              application of linear regression can restore experimental control
              when using MVPA in many situations. Finally, we present a case
              study with novel fMRI data in the domain of rule representations,
              or flexible stimulus-response mappings, which has seen several
              recent MVPA publications. In our new dataset, as with recent
              reports, standard MVPA appears to reveal rule representations in
              prefrontal cortex regions, whereas GLMA produces null results.
              However, controlling for a variable that is confounded with rule
              at the individual-subject level but not the group level (reaction
              time differences across rules) eliminates the MVPA results. This
              raises the question of whether recently reported results truly
              reflect rule representations, or rather the effects of confounds
              such as reaction time, difficulty, or other variables of no

              these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under
              study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such
              interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an
              appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon
              who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most
              important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and
              associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with
              paralyzed or comatose patients via brain-computer interfaces, it
              is most important to accurately extract the neural processes
              specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but
              complementary objectives require different analysis methods.
              Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from
              the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a
              forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured
              data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general
              linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural
              information from data can be considered as backward models, as
              they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are
              multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters
              of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the
              sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at
              channels the activity of which is related to the brain process
              under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model
              parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or
              temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since
              significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the
              activity of which is statistically independent of the brain
              process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose
              a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models.
              This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of
              the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work
              raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a

               multiple scanners with potentially different hardware and/or
               acquisition sequences and demographically heterogeneous groups.
               To improve classification performance, we propose to correct
               effects of subject-specific covariates (such as age, total
               intracranial volume, and sex) as well as effects of scanner by
               using a non-linear Gaussian process model. To test the efficacy
               of the correction, we performed classification of carriers of
               the genetic mutation leading to Huntington's disease (HD) versus
               healthy controls. Half of the HD carriers were free of typical
               HD symptoms and had an estimated 5 to 20years before onset of
               clinical symptoms, thus providing a model for preclinical
               diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disease. Structural magnetic
               resonance brain images were acquired at four sites with pairs of
               sites which had the identical scanner type, equipment, and
               acquisition parameters. For automatic classification, we used
               spatially normalized probabilistic maps of gray matter, then
               removed confounding effects by Gaussian process regression, and
               then performed classification with a support vector machine.
               Voxel-based morphometry of gray matter maps showed disease
               effects that were spatially wider spread than effects of
               scanner, but no significant interactions between scanner and
               disease were found. A model trained with data from a single
               scanner generalized well to data from a different scanner. When
               confounding diagnostics groups and scanner during training, e.g.
               by using controls from one scanner and gene carriers from
               another, classification accuracy dropped significantly in many
               cases. By regressing out confounds with Gaussian process
               regression, the performance levels were comparable to those
               obtained in scenarios without confound. We conclude that models
               trained on data acquired with a single scanner generalized well
               to data acquired with a different same-generation scanner even
               when the vendor differed. When confounding grouping and scanner
               during training is unavoidable to gather training data,
               regressing out inter-scanner and between-subject variability can
               reduce the loss in accuracy due to the confound.",

  abstract  = "Representational models specify how activity patterns in
               populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate
               brain-activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor
               responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context,
               representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the
               distribution of activity profiles across experimental
               conditions. Currently, three different methods are being used to
               test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component
               modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA).
               Here we develop a common mathematical framework for
               understanding the relationship of these three methods, which
               share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment
               of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the
               representational geometry, and thus how well any feature can be
               decoded from population activity. Using simulated data for three
               different experimental designs, we compare the power of the
               methods to adjudicate between competing representational models.
               PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides
               the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the
               other two approaches-when conducted appropriately-can perform
               similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be
               appropriately regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on
               the activity profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model
               specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In
               RSA, the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the
               dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach
               near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render

               ``information based'' approach in which the sign of the effect
               of individual subjects is discarded and a non-directional
               summary statistic is carried over to the second level. This is
               in contrast to a directional ``activation based'' approach
               typical in univariate group level analysis, in which both signal

               examining effects in one voxel at a time vs. several voxels

               neurologically normal women (n = 50) and men (n = 50). As
               expected, we found a significant sex difference for the absolute

               greater volumes for men. Relating these compartmental volume

               No significant sex differences were found for white matter and

              aim was to investigate structural grey and white matter
              abnormalities in adolescent-onset schizophrenia. Whole-brain
              voxel-wise investigation of both grey matter topography and white
              matter integrity (Fractional Anisotropy) were carried out on 25
              adolescent-onset schizophrenic patients and 25 healthy
              adolescents. We employed a refined voxel-based morphometry-like
              approach for grey matter analysis and the recently introduced
              method of tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) for white matter
              analysis. Both kinds of studies revealed widespread abnormalities
              characterized by a lower fractional anisotropy neuroanatomically
              associated with localized reduced grey matter in the
              schizophrenic group. The grey matter changes can either be
              interpreted as the result of a locally reduced cortical thickness
              or as a manifestation of different patterns of gyrification.
              There was a widespread reduction of anisotropy in the white
              matter, especially in the corpus callosum. We speculate that the
              anisotropy changes relate to the functional changes in brain
              connectivity that are thought to play a central role in the
              clinical expression of the disease. The distribution of grey
              matter changes was consistent with clinical features of the
              disease. For example, grey and white matter abnormalities found
              in the Heschl's gyrus, the parietal operculum, left Broca's area
              and the left arcuate fasciculus (similar to previous findings in
              adult-onset schizophrenia) are likely to relate to functional
              impairments of language and auditory perception. In addition, in
              contrast to earlier studies, we found striking abnormalities in
              the primary sensorimotor and premotor cortices and in white
              matter tracts susbserving motor control (mainly the pyramidal
              tract). This novel finding suggests a new potential marker of
              altered white matter maturation specific to adolescent-onset
              schizophrenia. Together, our observations suggest that the
              neuropathology of adolescent-onset schizophrenia involves larger
              and widespread changes than in the adult form, consistent with
              the greater clinical severity.",

               methodological features regarding search strategies, analysis of

               the influence of key variables (sex, migrant status, urbanicity,
               secular trend, economic status, and latitude). Contrary to
               previous interpretations, the incidence of schizophrenia shows
               prominent variation between sites. The median incidence of
               schizophrenia was 15.2/100,000 persons, and the central 80\% of
               estimates varied over a fivefold range (7.7-43.0/100,000). The
               rate ratio for males:females was 1.4:1. Prevalence estimates
               also show prominent variation. The median lifetime morbid risk
               for schizophrenia was 7.2/1,000 persons. On the basis of the
               standardized mortality ratio, people with schizophrenia have a
               two- to threefold increased risk of dying (median standardized
               mortality ratio = 2.6 for all-cause mortality), and this
               differential gap in mortality has increased over recent decades.
               Compared with native-born individuals, migrants have an
               increased incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia. Exposures

  abstract  = "Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain data provide a
               valuable tool for detecting structural differences associated
               with various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Analysis of
               such data, however, is not always straightforward, and
               complications can arise when trying to determine which brain
               structures are ``smaller'' or ``larger'' in light of the high
               degree of individual variability across the population. Several
               statistical methods for adjusting for individual differences in
               overall cranial or brain size have been used in the literature,
               but critical differences exist between them. Using agreement
               among those methods as an indication of stronger support of a
               hypothesis is dangerous given that each requires a different set
               of assumptions be met. Here we examine the theoretical
               underpinnings of three of these adjustment methods (proportion,
               residual, and analysis of covariance) and apply them to a
               volumetric MRI data set. These three methods used for adjusting
               for brain size are specific cases of a generalized approach
               which we propose as a recommended modeling strategy. We assess
               the level of agreement among methods and provide graphical tools
               to assist researchers in determining how they differ in the
               types of relationships they can unmask, and provide a useful
               method by which researchers may tease out important
               relationships in volumetric MRI data. We conclude with the
               recommended procedure involving the use of graphical analyses to
               help uncover potential relationships the ROI volumes may have
               with head size and give a generalized modeling strategy by which
               researchers can make such adjustments that include as special
               cases the three commonly employed methods mentioned above.",

               suggested a higher percentage of gray matter (GM) in left
               hemisphere cortex and in women, but differences in volumes of
               the major cranial compartments have not been examined for the
               entire brain in association with cognitive performance. We used
               volumetric segmentation of dual echo (proton density and
               T2-weighted) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in healthy
               volunteers (40 men, 40 women) age 18-45. Supertentorial volume
               was segmented into GM, white matter (WM), and CSF. We confirmed
               that women have a higher percentage of GM, whereas men have a
               higher percentage of WM and of CSF. These differences sustained
               a correction for total intracranial volume. In men the slope of
               the relation between cranial volume and GM paralleled that for
               WM, whereas in women the increase in WM as a function of cranial
               volume was at a lower rate. In men the percentage of GM was
               higher in the left hemisphere, the percentage of WM was
               symmetric, and the percentage of CSF was higher in the right.
               Women showed no asymmetries. Both GM and WM volumes correlated
               moderately with global, verbal, and spatial performance across
               groups. However, the regression of cognitive performance and WM
               volume was significantly steeper in women. Because GM consists
               of the somatodendritic tissue of neurons whereas WM comprises
               myelinated connecting axons, the higher percentage of GM makes
               more tissue available for computation relative to transfer
               across distant regions. This could compensate for smaller
               intracranial space in women. Sex difference in the percentage
               and asymmetry of the principal cranial tissue volumes may
               contribute to differences in cognitive functioning.",

  abstract  = "In multivariate pattern analysis of neuroimaging data,
               'second-level' inference is often performed by entering
               classification accuracies into a t-test vs chance level across
               subjects. We argue that while the random-effects analysis
               implemented by the t-test does provide population inference if
               applied to activation differences, it fails to do so in the case
               of classification accuracy or other 'information-like' measures,
               because the true value of such measures can never be below
               chance level. This constraint changes the meaning of the
               population-level null hypothesis being tested, which becomes
               equivalent to the global null hypothesis that there is no effect
               in any subject in the population. Consequently, rejecting it
               only allows to infer that there are some subjects in which there
               is an information effect, but not that it generalizes, rendering
               it effectively equivalent to fixed-effects analysis. This
               statement is supported by theoretical arguments as well as
               simulations. We review possible alternative approaches to
               population inference for information-based imaging, converging
               on the idea that it should not target the mean, but the
               prevalence of the effect in the population. One method to do so,

               methods based on the hippocampus) using 509 subjects from the

               CN vs AD, CN vs MCIc (MCI who had converted to AD within 18
               months, MCI converters - MCIc) and MCIc vs MCInc (MCI who had
               not converted to AD within 18 months, MCI non-converters -
               MCInc). Data from 81 CN, 67 MCInc, 39 MCIc and 69 AD were used
               for training and hyperparameters optimization. The remaining
               independent samples of 81 CN, 67 MCInc, 37 MCIc and 68 AD were
               used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the performance of the
               methods. For AD vs CN, whole-brain methods (voxel-based or
               cortical thickness-based) achieved high accuracies (up to 81\%
               sensitivity and 95\% specificity). For the detection of
               prodromal AD (CN vs MCIc), the sensitivity was substantially
               lower. For the prediction of conversion, no classifier obtained
               significantly better results than chance. We also compared the
               results obtained using the DARTEL registration to that using
               SPM5 unified segmentation. DARTEL significantly improved six out
               of 20 classification experiments and led to lower results in
               only two cases. Overall, the use of feature selection did not

  abstract  = "When training predictive models from neuroimaging data, we
               typically have available non-imaging variables such as age and

               uninterested in from a clinical perspective. Such variables are
               commonly referred to as 'confounds'. In this work, we firstly
               give a working definition for confound in the context of
               training predictive models from samples of neuroimaging data. We
               define a confound as a variable which affects the imaging data
               and has an association with the target variable in the sample
               that differs from that in the population-of-interest, i.e., the
               population over which we intend to apply the estimated
               predictive model. The focus of this paper is the scenario in
               which the confound and target variable are independent in the
               population-of-interest, but the training sample is biased due to
               a sample association between the target and confound. We then
               discuss standard approaches for dealing with confounds in
               predictive modelling such as image adjustment and including the
               confound as a predictor, before deriving and motivating an
               Instance Weighting scheme that attempts to account for confounds
               by focusing model training so that it is optimal for the
               population-of-interest. We evaluate the standard approaches and
               Instance Weighting in two regression problems with neuroimaging
               data in which we train models in the presence of confounding,
               and predict samples that are representative of the
               population-of-interest. For comparison, these models are also
               evaluated when there is no confounding present. In the first
               experiment we predict the MMSE score using structural MRI from
               the ADNI database with gender as the confound, while in the
               second we predict age using structural MRI from the IXI database
               with acquisition site as the confound. Considered over both
               datasets we find that none of the methods for dealing with
               confounding gives more accurate predictions than a baseline
               model which ignores confounding, although including the confound
               as a predictor gives models that are less accurate than the
               baseline model. We do find, however, that different methods
               appear to focus their predictions on specific subsets of the
               population-of-interest, and that predictive accuracy is greater
               when there is no confounding present. We conclude with a
               discussion comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each
               approach, and the implications of our evaluation for building
               predictive models that can be used in clinical practice.",

               rapidly in popularity for the analysis of magnetoencephalography

               performance and characteristics of the specific dissimilarity
               measures used to describe differences between evoked activation
               patterns. Here we used a multisession MEG data set to
               qualitatively characterize a range of dissimilarity measures and
               to quantitatively compare them with respect to decoding accuracy
               (for decoding) and between-session reliability of
               representational dissimilarity matrices (for RSA). We tested
               dissimilarity measures from a range of classifiers (Linear
               Discriminant Analysis - LDA, Support Vector Machine - SVM,
               Weighted Robust Distance - WeiRD, Gaussian Na{\"\i}ve Bayes -
               GNB) and distances (Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation). In
               addition, we evaluated three key processing choices: 1)
               preprocessing (noise normalisation, removal of the pattern
               mean), 2) weighting decoding accuracies by decision values, and
               3) computing distances in three different partitioning schemes
               (non-cross-validated, cross-validated, within-class-corrected).
               Four main conclusions emerged from our results. First,
               appropriate multivariate noise normalization substantially
               improved decoding accuracies and the reliability of
               dissimilarity measures. Second, LDA, SVM and WeiRD yielded high
               peak decoding accuracies and nearly identical time courses.
               Third, while using decoding accuracies for RSA was markedly less
               reliable than continuous distances, this disadvantage was
               ameliorated by decision-value-weighting of decoding accuracies.
               Fourth, the cross-validated Euclidean distance provided unbiased
               distance estimates and highly replicable representational
               dissimilarity matrices. Overall, we strongly advise the use of

              frames our research questions and methods. In this article, we
              offer an approach to thinking about variation in brain structure
              and function that pulls us outside the sex differences
              formulation. We argue that the existence of differences between
              the brains of males and females does not unravel the relations
              between sex and the brain nor is it sufficient to characterize a
              population of brains. Such characterization is necessary for
              studying sex effects on the brain as well as for studying brain
              structure and function in general. Animal studies show that sex
              interacts with environmental, developmental and genetic factors
              to affect the brain. Studies of humans further suggest that human
              brains are better described as belonging to a single

               questions remain regarding both the empirical and conceptual
               relationships between results from MVPA and standard univariate
               analyses. In the current study, whole-brain univariate and

  abstract  = "The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model
               for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR)
               images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise
               constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a
               histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no
               spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM
               model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of
               noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to
               artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field
               distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
               produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel
               hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic
               process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be
               observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through
               observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model
               is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the
               HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information
               is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites.
               Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation
               by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using
               MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the
               HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by
               incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a
               HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be
               achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be
               combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the
               bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997)
               can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a
               three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image

               represents intermediate features is still unclear. To further
               elucidate this, we compared the biologically plausible HMAX
               model and Bag of Words (BoW) model from computer vision. Both
               these computational models use visual dictionaries, candidate
               features of intermediate complexity, to represent visual scenes,
               and the models have been proven effective in automatic object
               and scene recognition. These models however differ in the

               investigated where in the brain and to what extent human fMRI
               responses to short video can be accounted for by multiple
               hierarchical levels of the HMAX and BoW models. Brain activity
               of 20 subjects obtained while viewing a short video clip was
               analyzed voxel-wise using a distance-based variation
               partitioning method. Results revealed that both HMAX and BoW
               explain a significant amount of brain activity in early visual
               regions V1, V2, and V3. However, BoW exhibits more consistency
               across subjects in accounting for brain activity compared to
               HMAX. Furthermore, visual dictionary representations by HMAX and
               BoW explain significantly some brain activity in higher areas
               which are believed to process intermediate features. Overall our
               results indicate that, although both HMAX and BoW account for
               activity in the human visual system, the BoW seems to more
