  abstract  = "People often seek out stories, videos or images that detail
               death, violence or harm. Considering the ubiquity of this
               behavior, it is surprising that we know very little about the
               neural circuits involved in choosing negative information. Using
               fMRI, the present study shows that choosing intensely negative
               stimuli engages similar brain regions as those that support
               extrinsic incentives and ``regular'' curiosity. Participants
               made choices to view negative and positive images, based on
               negative (e.g., a soldier kicks a civilian against his head) and
               positive (e.g., children throw flower petals at a wedding)
               verbal cues. We hypothesized that the conflicting, but
               relatively informative act of choosing to view a negative image,
               resulted in stronger activation of reward circuitry as opposed
               to the relatively uncomplicated act of choosing to view a
               positive stimulus. Indeed, as preregistered, we found that
               choosing negative cues was associated with activation of the
               striatum, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and anterior
               cingulate cortex, both when contrasting against a passive
               viewing condition, and when contrasting against positive cues.
               These findings nuance models of decision-making, valuation and
               curiosity, and are an important starting point when considering
               the value of seeking out negative content.",

  author    = "Oosterwijk, Suzanne",
  abstract  = "This paper examined, with a behavioral paradigm, to what extent
               people choose to view stimuli that portray death, violence or
               harm. Based on briefly presented visual cues, participants made
               choices between highly arousing, negative images and positive or
               negative alternatives. The negative images displayed social
               scenes that involved death, violence or harm (e.g., war scene),
               or decontextualized, close-ups of physical harm (e.g., mutilated
               face) or natural threat (e.g., attacking shark). The results
               demonstrated that social negative images were chosen
               significantly more often than other negative categories.
               Furthermore, participants preferred social negative images over
               neutral images. Physical harm images and natural threat images
               were not preferred over neutral images, but were chosen in about
               thirty-five percent of the trials. These results were replicated
               across three different studies, including a study that presented
               verbal descriptions of images as pre-choice cues. Together,
               these results show that people deliberately subject themselves

               subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance
               images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a
               dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs
               in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then
               encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to
               automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as
               the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system,
               we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a
               new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of
               mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When
               compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly
               accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs,
               and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and
               inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Clinical imaging data are typically stored and
               transferred in the DICOM format, whereas the NIfTI format has
               been widely adopted by scientists in the neuroimaging community.
               Therefore, a vital initial step in processing the data is to
               convert images from the complicated DICOM format to the much
               simpler NIfTI format. While there are a number of tools that
               usually handle DICOM to NIfTI conversion seamlessly, some
               variations can disrupt this process. NEW METHOD: We provide some
               insight into the challenges faced with image conversion. First,
               different manufacturers implement the DICOM format differently
               which complicates the conversion. Second, different modalities
               and sub-modalities may need special treatment during conversion.
               Lastly, the image transferring and archiving can also impact the
               DICOM conversion. RESULTS: We present results in several
               error-prone domains, including the slice order for functional
               imaging, phase encoding direction for distortion correction,
               effect of diffusion gradient direction, and effect of gantry
               correction for some imaging modality. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING
               METHODS: Conversion tools are often designed for a specific
               manufacturer or modality. The tools and insight we present here
               are aimed at different manufacturers or modalities. CONCLUSIONS:
               The imaging conversion is complicated by the variation of
               images. An understanding of the conversion basics can be helpful
               for identifying the source of the error. Here we provide users
               with simple methods for detecting and correcting problems. This

               involves numerous steps to clean and standardize the data before
               statistical analysis. Generally, researchers create ad hoc
               preprocessing workflows for each dataset, building upon a large
               inventory of available tools. The complexity of these workflows
               has snowballed with rapid advances in acquisition and
               processing. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic tool
               that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible
               preprocessing for fMRI data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a
               best-in-breed workflow to the idiosyncrasies of virtually any
               dataset, ensuring high-quality preprocessing without manual
               intervention. By introducing visual assessment checkpoints into
               an iterative integration framework for software testing, we show
               that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality results on a
               diverse fMRI data collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep introduces
               less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than observed with commonly
               used preprocessing tools. fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with
               an easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow, which can

               AND METHODS: A modified version of the retrospective image
               correction (RETROICOR) method (Glover et al, [2000] Magn Reson
               Med 44:162-167) was implemented on resting brainstem echo-planar
               imaging (EPI) data in 12 subjects. Fourier series were fitted to
               image data based on cardiac and respiratory recordings
               (pulseoximetry and respiratory turbine), including
               multiplicative terms that accounted for interactions between
               cardiac and respiratory signals. F-tests were performed on
               residuals produced by regression analysis. Additionally, we
               evaluated whether modified RETROICOR improved detection of
               brainstem activation (in 11 subjects) during a finger opposition
               task. RESULTS: The optimal model, containing three cardiac (C)
               and four respiratory (R) harmonics, and one multiplicative (X)
               term, ``3C4R1X,'' significantly reduced signal variability

               RETROICOR to activation data increased group Z-statistics and
               reduced putative false-positive activation. CONCLUSION: In
               addition to cardiac and respiratory effects, their interaction
               was also a significant source of physiological noise. The
               modified RETROICOR model improved detection of brainstem

               and separate packages, often requiring different software and
               language proficiencies. Although usable by expert researchers,
               novice users face a steep learning curve. These difficulties
               stem from the use of new programming languages (e.g., Python),
               learning how to apply machine-learning methods to
               high-dimensional fMRI data, and minimal documentation and
               training materials. Furthermore, most standard fMRI analysis
               packages (e.g., AFNI, FSL, SPM) focus on preprocessing and
               univariate analyses, leaving a gap in how to integrate with
               advanced tools. To address these needs, we developed BrainIAK
               (brainiak.org), an open-source Python software package that
               seamlessly integrates several cutting-edge, computationally
               efficient techniques with other Python packages (e.g., Nilearn,
               Scikit-learn) for file handling, visualization, and machine
               learning. To disseminate these powerful tools, we developed
               user-friendly tutorials (in Jupyter format;
               https://brainiak.org/tutorials/) for learning BrainIAK and
               advanced fMRI analysis in Python more generally. These materials
               cover techniques including: MVPA (pattern classification and

               on Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) protocols, is becoming increasingly
               important for neurosurgical applications. However, its use in
               this context is limited in part by significant spatial
               distortion inherent to EPI. METHOD: We evaluated an efficient
               algorithm for EPI distortion correction (EPIC) across 814 DWI
               scans from 250 brain tumor patients and quantified the magnitude
               of geometric distortion for whole brain and multiple brain
               regions. RESULTS: Evaluation of the algorithm's performance
               revealed significantly higher mutual information between
               T1-weighted pre-contrast images and corrected b = 0 images than
               the uncorrected b = 0 images (p < 0.001). The distortion
               magnitude across all voxels revealed a median EPI distortion
               effect of 2.1 mm, ranging from 1.2 mm to 5.9 mm, the 5th and
               95th percentile, respectively. Regions adjacent to bone-air
               interfaces, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, temporal poles,
               and brain stem, were the regions most severely affected by DWI
               distortion. CONCLUSION: Using EPIC to estimate the degree of
               distortion in 814 DWI brain tumor images enabled the creation of
               a topographic atlas of DWI distortion across the brain. The
               degree of displacement of tumors boundaries in uncorrected
               images is severe but can be corrected for using EPIC. Our
               results support the use of distortion correction to ensure

              opportunity to explore the neuropathology of schizophrenia free
              from the potential confounds of prolonged periods of medication
              and disease interactions with age-related neurodegeneration. Our
              aim was to investigate structural grey and white matter
              abnormalities in adolescent-onset schizophrenia. Whole-brain
              voxel-wise investigation of both grey matter topography and white
              matter integrity (Fractional Anisotropy) were carried out on 25
              adolescent-onset schizophrenic patients and 25 healthy
              adolescents. We employed a refined voxel-based morphometry-like
              approach for grey matter analysis and the recently introduced
              method of tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) for white matter
              analysis. Both kinds of studies revealed widespread abnormalities
              characterized by a lower fractional anisotropy neuroanatomically
              associated with localized reduced grey matter in the
              schizophrenic group. The grey matter changes can either be
              interpreted as the result of a locally reduced cortical thickness
              or as a manifestation of different patterns of gyrification.
              There was a widespread reduction of anisotropy in the white
              matter, especially in the corpus callosum. We speculate that the
              anisotropy changes relate to the functional changes in brain
              connectivity that are thought to play a central role in the
              clinical expression of the disease. The distribution of grey
              matter changes was consistent with clinical features of the
              disease. For example, grey and white matter abnormalities found
              in the Heschl's gyrus, the parietal operculum, left Broca's area
              and the left arcuate fasciculus (similar to previous findings in
              adult-onset schizophrenia) are likely to relate to functional
              impairments of language and auditory perception. In addition, in
              contrast to earlier studies, we found striking abnormalities in
              the primary sensorimotor and premotor cortices and in white
              matter tracts susbserving motor control (mainly the pyramidal
              tract). This novel finding suggests a new potential marker of
              altered white matter maturation specific to adolescent-onset
              schizophrenia. Together, our observations suggest that the
              neuropathology of adolescent-onset schizophrenia involves larger
              and widespread changes than in the adult form, consistent with
              the greater clinical severity.",

  abstract  = "Ensuring one is using the correct gradient orientations in a
               diffusion MRI study can be a challenging task. As different
               scanners, file formats and processing tools use different
               coordinate frame conventions, in practice, users can end up with
               improperly oriented gradient orientations. Using such wrongly
               oriented gradient orientations for subsequent diffusion
               parameter estimation will invalidate all rotationally variant
               parameters and fiber tractography results. While large
               misalignments can be detected by visual inspection, small
               rotations of the gradient table (e.g. due to angulation of the
               acquisition plane), are much more difficult to detect. In this
               work, we propose an automated method to align the coordinate
               frame of the gradient orientations with that of the
               corresponding diffusion weighted images, using a metric based on
               whole brain fiber tractography. By transforming the gradient
               table and measuring the average fiber trajectory length, we
               search for the transformation that results in the best global
               'connectivity'. To ensure a fast calculation of the metric we
               included a range of algorithmic optimizations in our
               tractography routine. To make the optimization routine robust to
               spurious local maxima, we use a stochastic optimization routine
               that selects a random set of seed points on each evaluation.
               Using simulations, we show that our method can recover the
               correct gradient orientations with high accuracy and precision.
               In addition, we demonstrate that our technique can successfully
               recover rotated gradient tables on a wide range of clinically
               realistic data sets. As such, our method provides a practical
               and robust solution to an often overlooked pitfall in the

               and remove the effects of this noise. While a hemodynamic

               can increase the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in
               top-down attentional control. In light of these findings, we
               hypothesize that PFC's involvement increases when
               task-irrelevant information competes for priority in processing.
               In an event-related fMRI study using an oddball variant of the

               three manipulations designed to increase the ability of
               task-irrelevant information to compete for priority in
               processing. First, we investigated how the frequency of
               occurrence of task-irrelevant information affects PFC activity.
               Second, we examined whether conflicting color information (i.e.
               incongruent trials) increases activity in regions of PFC that
               are similar to or distinct from those sensitive to infrequently
               occurring task-irrelevant information. Finally, we examined the
               impact of the number of levels at which conflict could occur
               (e.g. non-response only, non-response and response). Activity in
               posterior-dorsolateral and posterior-inferior PFC increased for
               infrequently occurring task-irrelevant information, being
               largest when the task-irrelevant information contained
               conflicting color-information. In contrast, increases in

               at the response level with only a small sub-region exhibiting
               sensitivity to non-response conflict as well. From these

               a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary
               (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally
               and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The
               classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site
               dataset (17 sites, N = 1102). We perform model selection
               evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion
               approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and
               estimate an accuracy of 76\%$\pm$13\% on new sites, using

  author    = "Zhang, Y and Brady, M and Smith, S",
  abstract  = "The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model
               for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR)
               images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise
               constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a
               histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no
               spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM
               model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of
               noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to
               artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field
               distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
               produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel
               hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic
               process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be
               observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through
               observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model
               is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the
               HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information
               is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites.
               Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation
               by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using
               MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the
               HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by
               incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a
               HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be
               achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be
               combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the
               bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997)
               can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a
               three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image

               instinctive emotional reactions through intellectual processes
               such as reasoning, rationalizing, and labeling our experiences.
               This study used functional MRI to identify the neural networks
               underlying this ability. Subjects either matched the affect of
               one of two faces to that of a simultaneously presented target
               face (a perceptual task) or identified the affect of a target
               face by choosing one of two simultaneously presented linguistic
               labels (an intellectual task). Matching angry or frightened
               expressions was associated with increased regional cerebral
               blood flow (rCBF) in the left and right amygdala, the brain's

               imaging is a major issue when conducting analyses of brain
               structural properties. An inaccurate INU correction may result
               in qualitative and quantitative misinterpretations. Several INU

               the specific parameter settings that need to be chosen by the
               user. Here we addressed the question of how to select the best
               input parameters for a specific INU correction algorithm. Our
               investigation was based on the INU correction algorithm
               implemented in SPM, but this can be in principle extended to any
               other algorithm requiring the selection of input parameters. We
               conducted a comprehensive comparison of indirect metrics for the
               assessment of INU correction performance, namely the coefficient
               of variation of white matter (CVWM), the coefficient of
               variation of gray matter (CVGM), and the coefficient of joint
               variation between white matter and gray matter (CJV). Using
               simulated MR data, we observed the CJV to be more accurate than
               CVWM and CVGM, provided that the noise level in the
               INU-corrected image was controlled by means of spatial
               smoothing. Based on the CJV, we developed a data-driven approach
               for selecting INU correction parameters, which could effectively
               work on actual MR images. To this end, we implemented an
               enhanced procedure for the definition of white and gray matter
               masks, based on which the CJV was calculated. Our approach was
               validated using actual T1-weighted images collected with 1.5 T,
               3 T, and 7 T MR scanners. We found that our procedure can
               reliably assist the selection of valid INU correction algorithm

               that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly
               when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of

               is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference

               surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then

               aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual

  abstract  = "Action selection often requires the transformation of visual
               information into motor plans. Preventing premature responses may
               entail the suppression of visual input and/or of prepared muscle
               activity. This study examined how the quality of visual
               information affects frontobasal ganglia (BG) routes associated
               with response selection and inhibition. Human fMRI data were
               collected from a stop task with visually degraded or intact face
               stimuli. During go trials, degraded spatial frequency
               information reduced the speed of information accumulation and
               response cautiousness. Effective connectivity analysis of the
               fMRI data showed action selection to emerge through the classic
               direct and indirect BG pathways, with inputs deriving form both
               prefrontal and visual regions. When stimuli were degraded,
               visual and prefrontal regions processing the stimulus
               information increased connectivity strengths toward BG, whereas
               regions evaluating visual scene content or response strategies
               reduced connectivity toward BG. Response inhibition during stop
               trials recruited the indirect and hyperdirect BG pathways, with
               input from visual and prefrontal regions. Importantly, when
               stimuli were nondegraded and processed fast, the optimal stop
               model contained additional connections from prefrontal to visual
               cortex. Individual differences analysis revealed that stronger
               prefrontal-to-visual connectivity covaried with faster
               inhibition times. Therefore, prefrontal-to-visual cortex
               connections appear to suppress the fast flow of visual input for
               the go task, such that the inhibition process can finish before
               the selection process. These results indicate response selection
               and inhibition within the BG to emerge through the interplay of
               top-down adjustments from prefrontal and bottom-up input from
               sensory cortex.",

               components of structural and functional brain image analysis.
               Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function
               to determine the best registration. To date, little attention
               has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though
               the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality
               of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization
               process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used
               multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get
               trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches
               are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a
               novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new
               optimization method is specifically designed for registering
               whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of
               producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima.
               The increased robustness of the method, compared to other
               commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In
               addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a
               series of experiments with motion correction. These motion
               correction experiments also investigate how the results are

               diffusion MRI for the estimation of diffusion parameters.
               Although adding proper weights is necessary to increase the
               precision of these linear estimators, there is no consensus on
               how to practically define them. In this study, the impact of the
               commonly used weighting strategies on the accuracy and precision
               of linear diffusion parameter estimators is evaluated and
               compared with the nonlinear least squares estimation approach.
               METHODS: Simulation and real data experiments were done to study
               the performance of the weighted linear least squares estimators
               with weights defined by (a) the squares of the respective noisy
               diffusion-weighted signals; and (b) the squares of the predicted
               signals, which are reconstructed from a previous estimate of the
               diffusion model parameters. RESULTS: The negative effect of
               weighting strategy (a) on the accuracy of the estimator was
               surprisingly high. Multi-step weighting strategies yield better
               performance and, in some cases, even outperformed the nonlinear
               least squares estimator. CONCLUSION: If proper weighting
               strategies are applied, the weighted linear least squares
               approach shows high performance characteristics in terms of
               accuracy/precision and may even be preferred over nonlinear
               estimation methods.",

               with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI). However,
               drawing valid inferences, particularly for group comparisons, is
               fraught with pitfalls. Differing levels of brain-wide
               correlations can confound group comparisons. Global signal
               regression (GSReg) attempts to reduce this confound and is
               commonly used, even though it differentially biases correlations
               over brain regions, potentially leading to false group
               differences. We propose to use average brain-wide correlations
               as a measure of global correlation (GCOR), and examine the
               circumstances under which it can be used to identify or correct
               for differences in global fluctuations. In the process, we show
               the bias induced by GSReg to be a function only of the data's
               covariance matrix, and use simulations to compare corrections
               with GCOR as covariate to GSReg under various scenarios. We find
               that unlike GSReg, GCOR is a conservative approach that can
               reduce global variations, while avoiding the introduction of
               false significant differences, as GSReg can. However, as with
               GSReg, one cannot escape the interaction effect between the
               grouping variable and GCOR covariate on effect size. While GCOR
               is a complementary measure for resting state-FMRI applicable to
               legacy data, it is a lesser substitute for proper level-I
               denoising. We also assess the applicability of GCOR to empirical
               data with motion-based subject grouping and compare group
               differences to those using GSReg. We find that, while GCOR
               reduced correlation differences between high and low movers, it
               is doubtful that motion was the sole driver behind the
               differences in the first place.",

  abstract  = "Performance on traditional selective attention tasks, like the

               history, whereby the magnitude of congruency (or conflict)
               effects is often found to decrease following an incongruent
               trial compared to a congruent one. These ``congruency sequence
               effects'' (CSEs) typically appear to reflect a mesh of memory-
               and attention-based processes. The current study aimed to shed
               new light on the nature of the attention-based contribution to
               CSEs, by characterizing the shape of the CSE time-course while
               controlling for mnemonic influences. Existing attention-based
               accounts of CSEs are either ambiguous in their predictions of
               CSE time-courses, or predict CSEs to persist or grow over the
               post-stimulus/response interval in anticipation of an upcoming
               stimulus. We gauged CSE time-courses by systematically varying
               inter-stimulus (Experiment 1) and response-to-stimulus
               (Experiment 2) intervals across a wide temporal range, in a

               the likelihood of stimulus appearance with increasing interval
               duration (i.e., an exponential hazard function), results from
               both experiments showed CSEs to be most pronounced at the
               shortest intervals, to quickly decay in magnitude with
               increasing interval length, and to be absent at longer
               intervals. These data refute the idea that attentional
               contributions to CSEs remain static over post-stimulus/response
               intervals and are incompatible with the notion that CSEs reflect
               expectation-guided preparatory biasing in anticipation of a
               forthcoming stimulus. The data are compatible, however, with the
               notion that attentional contributions to CSEs reflect a

  abstract  = "Over the past decade, multivariate ``decoding analyses'' have
               become a popular alternative to traditional mass-univariate
               analyses in neuroimaging research. However, a fundamental
               limitation of using decoding analyses is that it remains
               ambiguous which source of information drives decoding
               performance, which becomes problematic when the to-be-decoded
               variable is confounded by variables that are not of primary
               interest. In this study, we use a comprehensive set of
               simulations as well as analyses of empirical data to evaluate
               two methods that were previously proposed and used to control
               for confounding variables in decoding analyses: post hoc
               counterbalancing and confound regression. In our empirical
               analyses, we attempt to decode gender from structural MRI data
               while controlling for the confound ``brain size''. We show that
               both methods introduce strong biases in decoding performance:
               post hoc counterbalancing leads to better performance than
               expected (i.e., positive bias), which we show in our simulations
               is due to the subsampling process that tends to remove samples
               that are hard to classify or would be wrongly classified;
               confound regression, on the other hand, leads to worse
               performance than expected (i.e., negative bias), even resulting
               in significant below chance performance in some realistic
               scenarios. In our simulations, we show that below chance
               accuracy can be predicted by the variance of the distribution of
               correlations between the features and the target. Importantly,
               we show that this negative bias disappears in both the empirical
               analyses and simulations when the confound regression procedure
               is performed in every fold of the cross-validation routine,
               yielding plausible (above chance) model performance. We conclude
               that, from the various methods tested, cross-validated confound
               regression is the only method that appears to appropriately
               control for confounds which thus can be used to gain more
               insight into the exact source(s) of information driving one's

               intermediate complexity. How the brain computationally
               represents intermediate features is still unclear. To further
               elucidate this, we compared the biologically plausible HMAX
               model and Bag of Words (BoW) model from computer vision. Both
               these computational models use visual dictionaries, candidate
               features of intermediate complexity, to represent visual scenes,
               and the models have been proven effective in automatic object
               and scene recognition. These models however differ in the
               computation of visual dictionaries and pooling techniques. We
               investigated where in the brain and to what extent human fMRI
               responses to short video can be accounted for by multiple
               hierarchical levels of the HMAX and BoW models. Brain activity
               of 20 subjects obtained while viewing a short video clip was
               analyzed voxel-wise using a distance-based variation

               explain a significant amount of brain activity in early visual
               regions V1, V2, and V3. However, BoW exhibits more consistency

               results indicate that, although both HMAX and BoW account for
               activity in the human visual system, the BoW seems to more

               methods typically used to analyse fMRI data. We tested the
               effects of higher temporal resolutions for fMRI on statistical
               outcome measures in a comprehensive manner on two different MRI
               scanner platforms. Spatial resolution was maintained at a
               constant of 3 mm isotropic voxels, and an in-plane acceleration
               factor of 2 was used for all experiments. Experiment 1 tested a
               range of acceleration factors (1-6) against a standard EPI
               protocol on a single composite task that mapped a number of
               basic sensory, motor, and cognitive networks. Experiment 2
               compared the standard protocol with acceleration factors of 2
               and 3 on both resting-state and two task paradigms (an N-back
               task, and faces/places task), with a number of different
               analysis approaches. Results from experiment 1 showed modest but
               relatively inconsistent effects of the higher sampling rate on
               statistical outcome measures. Experiment 2 showed strong
               benefits of the multiband protocols on results derived from
               resting-state data, but more varied effects on results from the
               task paradigms. Notably, the multiband protocols were superior
               when Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis was used to interrogate the
               faces/places data, but showed less benefit in conventional
               General Linear Model analyses of the same data. In general,
               ROI-derived measures of statistical effects benefitted only
               modestly from higher sampling resolution, with greater effects
               seen when using a measure of the top range of statistical
               values. Across both experiments, results from the two scanner
               platforms were broadly comparable. The statistical benefits of
               high temporal resolution fMRI with multiband protocols may
               therefore depend on a number of factors, including the nature of

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Physiological noise is one of the major confounds
               for fMRI. A common class of correction methods model noise from
               peripheral measures, such as ECGs or pneumatic belts. However,
               physiological noise correction has not emerged as a standard
               preprocessing step for fMRI data yet due to: (1) the varying
               data quality of physiological recordings, (2) non-standardized
               peripheral data formats and (3) the lack of full automatization
               of processing and modeling physiology, required for large-cohort
               studies. NEW METHODS: We introduce the PhysIO Toolbox for
               preprocessing of physiological recordings and model-based noise
               correction. It implements a variety of noise models, such as
               RETROICOR, respiratory volume per time and heart rate
               variability responses (RVT/HRV). The toolbox covers all
               intermediate steps - from flexible read-in of data formats to
               GLM regressor/contrast creation - without any manual
               intervention. RESULTS: We demonstrate the workflow of the
               toolbox and its functionality for datasets from different
               vendors, recording devices, field strengths and subject
               populations. Automatization of physiological noise correction
               and performance evaluation are reported in a group study (N=35).
               COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The PhysIO Toolbox reproduces
               physiological noise patterns and correction efficacy of
               previously implemented noise models. It increases modeling
               robustness by outperforming vendor-provided peak detection
               methods for physiological cycles. Finally, the toolbox offers an
               integrated framework with full automatization, including
               performance monitoring, and flexibility with respect to the
               input data. CONCLUSIONS: Through its platform-independent Matlab
               implementation, open-source distribution, and modular structure,
               the PhysIO Toolbox renders physiological noise correction an
               accessible preprocessing step for fMRI data.",

               representative sample of the Dutch population on two attentional
               tasks: a visual search task gauging the efficiency of top-down
               attention and a singleton capture task gauging bottom-up
               attention. On both tasks we found typical performance--i.e.,
               participants displayed a significant search slope on the search
               task and significant slowing caused by the unique, but
               irrelevant, object on the capture task. Moreover, the high
               levels of significance we observed indicate that the current
               set-up provided very high signal to noise ratios, and thus
               enough power to accurately unveil existing effects. Importantly,

               These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation

               redundant series of magnitude MR images. METHODS: We exploit
               redundancy in non-Gaussian distributed multidirectional
               diffusion MRI data by identifying its noise-only principal
               components, based on the theory of noisy covariance matrices.
               The bulk of principal component analysis eigenvalues, arising
               due to noise, is described by the universal Marchenko-Pastur
               distribution, parameterized by the noise level. This allows us
               to estimate noise level in a local neighborhood based on the
               singular value decomposition of a matrix combining neighborhood
               voxels and diffusion directions. RESULTS: We present a
               model-independent local noise mapping method capable of
               estimating the noise level down to about 1\% error. In contrast
               to current state-of-the-art techniques, the resultant noise maps
               do not show artifactual anatomical features that often reflect
               physiological noise, the presence of sharp edges, or a lack of
               adequate a priori knowledge of the expected form of MR signal.
               CONCLUSIONS: Simulations and experiments show that typical
               diffusion MRI data exhibit sufficient redundancy that enables
               accurate, precise, and robust estimation of the local noise

               gibbs-ringing artifact. METHODS: Gibbs-ringing is a well-known
               artifact which manifests itself as spurious oscillations in the
               vicinity of sharp image gradients at tissue boundaries. The
               origin can be seen in the truncation of k-space during MRI
               data-acquisition. Correction techniques like Gegenbauer
               reconstruction or extrapolation methods aim at recovering these
               missing data. Here, we present a simple and robust method which
               exploits a different view on the Gibbs-phenomenon: The
               truncation in k-space can be interpreted as a convolution of the
               underlying image with a sinc-function. As the image is
               reconstructed on a discretized grid, the severity of the ringing
               artifacts depends on how this grid is located with respect to
               the edge and the oscillation pattern of the function. We propose
               to reinterpolate the image based on local, subvoxel-shifts to
               sample the ringing pattern at the zero-crossings of the
               oscillating sinc-function. RESULTS: With the proposed method,
               the artifact can simply, effectively, and robustly be removed
               with a minimal amount of image smoothing. CONCLUSIONS: The
               robustness of the method suggests it as a suitable candidate for

  abstract  = "Despite its great potential in studying brain anatomy and
               structure, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is marred
               by artefacts more than any other commonly used MRI technique. In
               this paper we present a non-parametric framework for detecting
               and correcting dMRI outliers (signal loss) caused by subject
               motion. Signal loss (dropout) affecting a whole slice, or a
               large connected region of a slice, is frequently observed in
               diffusion weighted images, leading to a set of unusable
               measurements. This is caused by bulk (subject or physiological)
               motion during the diffusion encoding part of the imaging
               sequence. We suggest a method to detect slices affected by
               signal loss and replace them by a non-parametric prediction, in
               order to minimise their impact on subsequent analysis. The
               outlier detection and replacement, as well as correction of
               other dMRI distortions (susceptibility-induced distortions, eddy
               currents (EC) and subject motion) are performed within a single
               framework, allowing the use of an integrated approach for
               distortion correction. Highly realistic simulations have been
               used to evaluate the method with respect to its ability to
               detect outliers (types 1 and 2 errors), the impact of outliers
               on retrospective correction of movement and distortion and the
               impact on estimation of commonly used diffusion tensor metrics,
               such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD).
               Data from a large imaging project studying older adults (the
               Whitehall Imaging sub-study) was used to demonstrate the utility
               of the method when applied to datasets with severe subject
               movement. The results indicate high sensitivity and specificity
               for detecting outliers and that their deleterious effects on FA
               and MD can be almost completely corrected.",
