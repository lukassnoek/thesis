               {Models---A} New Proposal: The Coefficient of Discrimination",
  author    = "Tjur, Tue",
  abstract  = "Many analogues to the coefficient of determination R2 in
               ordinary regression models have been proposed in the context of
               logistic regression. Our starting point is a study of three
               definitions related to quadratic measures of variation. We
               discuss the properties of these statistics, and show that the
               family can be extended in a natural way by a fourth statistic
               with an even simpler interpretation, namely the difference
               between the averages of fitted values for successes and
               failures, respectively. We propose the name ?the coefficient of
               discrimination? for this statistic, and recommend its use as a
               standard measure of explanatory power. In its intuitive
               interpretation, this quantity has no immediate relation to the
               classical versions of R2, but it turns out to be related to
               these by two exact relations, which imply that all these
               statistics are asymptotically equivalent.",

               neuroscience needs to adjust some widespread practices to avoid
               the circularity that can arise from selection. In particular,
               'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and
               selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics
               and invalid statistical inference whenever the results
               statistics are not inherently independent of the selection
               criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem,
               we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain
               the experimental effects in question. Spurious effects can
               appear in the context of both univariate activation analysis and
               multivariate pattern-information analysis. We suggest a policy

  abstract  = "As a highly social species, humans frequently exchange social
               information to support almost all facets of life. One of the
               richest and most powerful tools in social communication is the
               face, from which observers can quickly and easily make a number
               of inferences - about identity, gender, sex, age, race,
               ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical health, attractiveness,
               emotional state, personality traits, pain or physical pleasure,
               deception, and even social status. With the advent of the
               digital economy, increasing globalization and cultural
               integration, understanding precisely which face information
               supports social communication and which produces
               misunderstanding is central to the evolving needs of modern
               society (for example, in the design of socially interactive
               digital avatars and companion robots). Doing so is challenging,
               however, because the face can be thought of as comprising a
               high-dimensional, dynamic information space, and this impacts
               cognitive science and neuroimaging, and their broader
               applications in the digital economy. New opportunities to
               address this challenge are arising from the development of new
               methods and technologies, coupled with the emergence of a modern
               scientific culture that embraces cross-disciplinary approaches.

               little evidence that these inferences accurately reflect
               personality. The authors tested the hypothesis that these
               inferences are driven in part by structural resemblance to
               emotional expressions. The authors first had participants judge
               emotionally neutral faces on a set of trait dimensions. The
               authors then submitted the face images to a Bayesian network
               classifier trained to detect emotional expressions. By using a
               classifier, the authors can show that neutral faces perceived to
               possess various personality traits contain objective resemblance
               to emotional expression. In general, neutral faces that are
               perceived to have positive valence resemble happiness, faces
               that are perceived to have negative valence resemble disgust and
               fear, and faces that are perceived to be threatening resemble
               anger. These results support the idea that trait inferences are

               systems, which typically extract accurate information about a

               anger and joyful expressions, respectively. First, in Study 1 we
               found that angry expressions naturally contain more
               inward-pointing lines, whereas joyful expressions contain more
               outward-pointing lines. Then, using image-processing techniques
               in Studies 2 and 3, we filtered images to contain only
               inward-pointing or outward-pointing lines as a way to
               approximate angularity and roundness. We found that filtering
               images to be more angular increased how threatening and angry a
               neutral face was rated, increased how intense angry expressions
               were rated, and enhanced the recognition of anger. Conversely,
               filtering images to be rounder increased how warm and joyful a
               neutral face was rated, increased the intensity of joyful
               expressions, and enhanced recognition of joy. Together these
               findings show that angularity and roundness play a direct role
               in the recognition of angry and joyful expressions. Given
               evidence that angularity and roundness may play a biological
               role in indicating threat and safety in the environment, this
               suggests that angularity and roundness represent primitive
               facial cues used to signal threat-anger and warmth-joy pairings.

  abstract  = "Using a dynamic stimuli paradigm, in which faces expressed
               either happiness or anger, the authors tested the hypothesis
               that perceptions of trustworthiness are related to these
               expressions. Although the same emotional intensity was added to
               both trustworthy and untrustworthy faces, trustworthy faces who
               expressed happiness were perceived as happier than untrustworthy
               faces, and untrustworthy faces who expressed anger were
               perceived as angrier than trustworthy faces. The authors also
               manipulated changes in face trustworthiness simultaneously with
               the change in expression. Whereas transitions in face
               trustworthiness in the direction of the expressed emotion (e.g.,
               high-to-low trustworthiness and anger) increased the perceived
               intensity of the emotion, transitions in the opposite direction
               decreased this intensity. For example, changes from high to low
               trustworthiness increased the intensity of perceived anger but
               decreased the intensity of perceived happiness. These findings
               support the hypothesis that changes along the trustworthiness

  abstract  = "Good metrics of the performance of a statistical or
               computational model are essential for model comparison and
               selection. Here, we address the design of performance metrics
               for models that aim to predict neural responses to sensory
               inputs. This is particularly difficult because the responses of
               sensory neurons are inherently variable, even in response to
               repeated presentations of identical stimuli. In this situation,
               standard metrics (such as the correlation coefficient) fail
               because they do not distinguish between explainable variance
               (the part of the neural response that is systematically
               dependent on the stimulus) and response variability (the part of
               the neural response that is not systematically dependent on the
               stimulus, and cannot be explained by modeling the
               stimulus-response relationship). As a result, models which
               perfectly describe the systematic stimulus-response relationship
               may appear to perform poorly. Two metrics have previously been
               proposed which account for this inherent variability: Signal
               Power Explained (SPE, Sahani and Linden, 2003), and the
               normalized correlation coefficient (CC norm , Hsu et al., 2004).
               Here, we analyze these metrics, and show that they are
               intimately related. However, SPE has no lower bound, and we show
               that, even for good models, SPE can yield negative values that
               are difficult to interpret. CC norm is better behaved in that it
               is effectively bounded between -1 and 1, and values below zero
               are very rare in practice and easy to interpret. However, it was
               hitherto not possible to calculate CC norm directly; instead, it
               was estimated using imprecise and laborious resampling
               techniques. Here, we identify a new approach that can calculate
               CC norm quickly and accurately. As a result, we argue that it is
               now a better choice of metric than SPE to accurately evaluate

               'second-level' inference is often performed by entering
               classification accuracies into a t-test vs chance level across
               subjects. We argue that while the random-effects analysis
               implemented by the t-test does provide population inference if
               applied to activation differences, it fails to do so in the case
               of classification accuracy or other 'information-like' measures,
               because the true value of such measures can never be below
               chance level. This constraint changes the meaning of the
               population-level null hypothesis being tested, which becomes
               equivalent to the global null hypothesis that there is no effect
               in any subject in the population. Consequently, rejecting it
               only allows to infer that there are some subjects in which there
               is an information effect, but not that it generalizes, rendering
               it effectively equivalent to fixed-effects analysis. This
               statement is supported by theoretical arguments as well as
               simulations. We review possible alternative approaches to
               population inference for information-based imaging, converging
               on the idea that it should not target the mean, but the
               prevalence of the effect in the population. One method to do so,

               Martinez, Aleix M and Pollak, Seth D",
  abstract  = "It is commonly assumed that a person's emotional state can be
               readily inferred from his or her facial movements, typically
               called emotional expressions or facial expressions. This
               assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions,
               national security protocols, and educational practices; guides
               the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as
               the development of commercial applications; and pervades
               everyday social interactions as well as research in other
               scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience,
               and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this
               widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and
               we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view,
               focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by
               consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness,
               sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence
               suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when
               sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common
               view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people
               communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and
               surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and
               even across people within a single situation. Furthermore,
               similar configurations of facial movements variably express
               instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given
               configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often
               communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists
               agree that facial movements convey a range of information and
               are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise.
               But our review suggests an urgent need for research that
               examines how people actually move their faces to express
               emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts
               that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the
               mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one
               another. We make specific research recommendations that will
               yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to
               express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from
               facial movements in situations of everyday life. This research
               is crucial to provide consumers of emotion research with the
               translational information they require.",

               the role of visual prediction in driving these intersectional

               the majority of efforts on facial emotion recognition research
               have focused on adults. Children, particularly in their early
               years, have been shown to express emotions quite differently

  abstract  = "Facial expressions of emotion in humans are believed to be
               produced by contracting one's facial muscles, generally called
               action units. However, the surface of the face is also
               innervated with a large network of blood vessels. Blood flow
               variations in these vessels yield visible color changes on the
               face. Here, we study the hypothesis that these visible facial
               colors allow observers to successfully transmit and visually
               interpret emotion even in the absence of facial muscle
               activation. To study this hypothesis, we address the following
               two questions. Are observable facial colors consistent within
               and differential between emotion categories and positive vs.
               negative valence? And does the human visual system use these
               facial colors to decode emotion from faces? These questions
               suggest the existence of an important, unexplored mechanism of
               the production of facial expressions of emotion by a sender and
               their visual interpretation by an observer. The results of our
               studies provide evidence in favor of our hypothesis. We show
               that people successfully decode emotion using these color
               features, even in the absence of any facial muscle activation.
               We also demonstrate that this color signal is independent from
               that provided by facial muscle movements. These results support
               a revised model of the production and perception of facial

  abstract  = "People routinely make various trait judgments from facial
               appearance, and such judgments affect important social outcomes.
               These judgments are highly correlated with each other,
               reflecting the fact that valence evaluation permeates trait
               judgments from faces. Trustworthiness judgments best approximate
               this evaluation, consistent with evidence about the involvement
               of the amygdala in the implicit evaluation of face
               trustworthiness. Based on computer modeling and behavioral
               experiments, I argue that face evaluation is an extension of
               functionally adaptive systems for understanding the
               communicative meaning of emotional expressions. Specifically, in
               the absence of diagnostic emotional cues, trustworthiness
               judgments are an attempt to infer behavioral intentions
               signaling approach/avoidance behaviors. Correspondingly, these
               judgments are derived from facial features that resemble
               emotional expressions signaling such behaviors: happiness and
               anger for the positive and negative ends of the trustworthiness
               continuum, respectively. The emotion overgeneralization
               hypothesis can explain highly efficient but not necessarily
               accurate trait judgments from faces, a pattern that appears
               puzzling from an evolutionary point of view and also generates
               novel predictions about brain responses to faces. Specifically,
               this hypothesis predicts a nonlinear response in the amygdala to
               face trustworthiness, confirmed in functional magnetic resonance
               imaging (fMRI) studies, and dissociations between processing of
               facial identity and face evaluation, confirmed in studies with
               developmental prosopagnosics. I conclude with some
               methodological implications for the study of face evaluation,

               been frequently shown to be of high importance, research on
               facial action units has made more precise predictions about the
               areas involved in displaying each emotion. The present research
               investigated on a fine-grained level, which physical features
               are most relied on when decoding facial expressions. In the
               experiment, individual faces expressing the basic emotions
               according to Ekman were hidden behind a mask of 48 tiles, which
               was sequentially uncovered. Participants were instructed to stop
               the sequence as soon as they recognized the facial expression
               and assign it the correct label. For each part of the face, its
               contribution to successful recognition was computed, allowing to
               visualize the importance of different face areas for each
               expression. Overall, observers were mostly relying on the eye
               and mouth regions when successfully recognizing an emotion.
               Furthermore, the difference in the importance of eyes and mouth
               allowed to group the expressions in a continuous space, ranging
               from sadness and fear (reliance on the eyes) to disgust and
               happiness (mouth). The face parts with highest diagnostic value
               for expression identification were typically located in areas
               corresponding to action units from the facial action coding
               system. A similarity analysis of the usefulness of different
               face parts for expression recognition demonstrated that faces
               cluster according to the emotion they express, rather than by
               low-level physical features. Also, expressions relying more on
               the eyes or mouth region were in close proximity in the

               understand how human observers process expressions of emotion,

               states and the boundaries between emotion categories-that is,
               the geometric organization of the semantic space of emotion-have
               sparked intense debate. Here we introduce a conceptual framework
               to analyze reported emotional states elicited by 2,185 short
               videos, examining the richest array of reported emotional
               experiences studied to date and the extent to which reported
               experiences of emotion are structured by discrete and
               dimensional geometries. Across self-report methods, we find that
               the videos reliably elicit 27 distinct varieties of reported
               emotional experience. Further analyses revealed that categorical
               labels such as amusement better capture reports of subjective
               experience than commonly measured affective dimensions (e.g.,
               valence and arousal). Although reported emotional experiences
               are represented within a semantic space best captured by
               categorical labels, the boundaries between categories of emotion
               are fuzzy rather than discrete. By analyzing the distribution of

               anxiety to fear to horror to disgust, calmness to aesthetic
               appreciation to awe, and others-that correspond to smooth
               variation in affective dimensions such as valence and dominance.

               how facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR), a stable feature of all
               faces, influences perceivers' judgments of expressive displays
               of anger and fear (Studies 1a, 1b, \& 2), and anger and

               anger on faces with high fWHR compared with those with low fWHR,
               which instead facilitates the recognition of fear and happiness.

               morphological changes in a face and an affective component
               conveying information about the expresser's internal feelings.
               It remains unresolved how much recognition and discrimination of
               expressions rely on the perception of morphological patterns or
               the processing of affective content. This review of research on
               the role of visual and emotional factors in expression
               recognition reached three major conclusions. First, behavioral,
               neurophysiological, and computational measures indicate that
               basic expressions are reliably recognized and discriminated from
               one another, albeit the effect may be inflated by the use of
               prototypical expression stimuli and forced-choice responses.
               Second, affective content along the dimensions of valence and
               arousal is extracted early from facial expressions, although
               this coarse affective representation contributes minimally to
               categorical recognition of specific expressions. Third, the
               physical configuration and visual saliency of facial features
               contribute significantly to expression recognition, with
               ``emotionless'' computational models being able to reproduce
               some of the basic phenomena demonstrated in human observers. We

               expressions write their emotional messages. In fact, facial
               appearance and facial movement are both important social
               signalling systems in their own right. We here provide multiple
               lines of evidence for the notion that the social signals derived
               from facial appearance on the one hand and facial movement on
               the other interact in a complex manner, sometimes reinforcing
               and sometimes contradicting one another. Faces provide
               information on who a person is. Sex, age, ethnicity, personality
               and other characteristics that can define a person and the
               social group the person belongs to can all be derived from the
               face alone. The present article argues that faces interact with
               the perception of emotion expressions because this information
               informs a decoder's expectations regarding an expresser's
               probable emotional reactions. Facial appearance also interacts
               more directly with the interpretation of facial movement because
               some of the features that are used to derive personality or sex
               information are also features that closely resemble certain
               emotional expressions, thereby enhancing or diluting the

               anger, happiness, sadness and so on) are not representative of
               the full spectrum of emotions displayed by humans on a daily
               basis, psychologists typically rely on dimensional measures,
               namely valence (how positive the emotional display is) and
               arousal (how calming or exciting the emotional display looks
               like). However, while estimating these values from a face is
               natural for humans, it is extremely difficult for computer-based
               systems and automatic estimation of valence and arousal in

               visual signs of emotions can be important for psychological
               studies and even human--computer interactions. Instead of only
               ascribing discrete emotions, Toisoul and colleagues use a single

               detecting activation within the study group since in order to be
               significant, an activation has to be larger than the
               inter-subject variability. Indeed, detected regions are smaller
               when using random effect analysis versus fixed effects. The
               statistical assumptions behind the classic random effect model
               are that the effect in each location is normally distributed
               over subjects, and ``activation'' refers to a non-null mean
               effect. We argue that this model is unrealistic compared to the

               inconsistencies and registration anomalies, some of the subjects

               Although highly dynamical, little is known about the form and
               function of facial expression temporal dynamics. Do facial
               expressions transmit diagnostic signals simultaneously to

               actively using our faces to express ourselves (i.e., when we
               display nonexpressive, or neutral faces), those around us will
               not be able to read our emotions. Herein, using a variety of
               expression-related ratings, we examined whether age-related
               changes in the face can accurately reveal one's innermost
               affective dispositions. In each study, we found that expressive
               ratings of neutral facial displays predicted self-reported
               positive/negative dispositional affect, but only for elderly
               women, and only for positive affect. These findings meaningfully
               replicate and extend earlier work examining age-related emotion
               cues in the face of elderly women (Malatesta et al., 1987a). We
               discuss these findings in light of evidence that women are
               expected to, and do, smile more than men, and that the quality
               of their smiles predicts their life satisfaction. Although
               ratings of old male faces did not significantly predict
               self-reported affective dispositions, the trend was similar to
               that found for old female faces. A plausible explanation for
               this gender difference is that in the process of attenuating
               emotional expressions over their lifetimes, old men reveal less

               Since its publication, there has been a strong, spirited debate
               over the origin, nature, and function of emotional expressions.
               In this article, I consider two basic questions: What did Darwin

               account match the modern, conventional, ?basic emotion? account?
               And does the scientific evidence specifically support the modern

               recognition is highly adopted in developing human-computer

               triangulation method for extracting a novel set of geometric
               features is proposed to classify six emotional expressions
               (sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and happiness) using
               computer-generated markers. The subject's face is recognized by
               using Haar-like features. A mathematical model has been applied
               to positions of eight virtual markers in a defined location on
               the subject's face in an automated way. Five triangles are
               formed by manipulating eight markers' positions as an edge of
               each triangle. Later, these eight markers are uninterruptedly
               tracked by Lucas- Kanade optical flow algorithm while subjects'
               articulating facial expressions. The movement of the markers

               with a summary of the representative categories of FER systems
               and their main algorithms. Deep-learning-based FER approaches
               using deep networks enabling ``end-to-end'' learning are then

               expressions of emotion has remained one of the longest standing
               debates in the biological and social sciences. Briefly stated,
               the universality hypothesis claims that all humans communicate
               six basic internal emotional states (happy, surprise, fear,
               disgust, anger, and sad) using the same facial movements by
               virtue of their biological and evolutionary origins [Susskind
               JM, et al. (2008) Nat Neurosci 11:843-850]. Here, we refute this
               assumed universality. Using a unique computer graphics platform
               that combines generative grammars [Chomsky N (1965) MIT Press,
               Cambridge, MA] with visual perception, we accessed the mind's
               eye of 30 Western and Eastern culture individuals and
               reconstructed their mental representations of the six basic
               facial expressions of emotion. Cross-cultural comparisons of the
               mental representations challenge universality on two separate
               counts. First, whereas Westerners represent each of the six
               basic emotions with a distinct set of facial movements common to
               the group, Easterners do not. Second, Easterners represent
               emotional intensity with distinctive dynamic eye activity. By
               refuting the long-standing universality hypothesis, our data
               highlight the powerful influence of culture on shaping basic
               behaviors once considered biologically hardwired. Consequently,

               Eastern compared to Western groups (see [4] for a meta-analysis
               and [5, 6] for review). Here, focusing on the decoding of facial

               adaptive preferences for specific male physical traits. Physical
               strength may be one of those traits, because recent research

               masculine, dominant, and attractive. Yet, previous research has
               been limited in its ability to statistically map specific male
               facial shapes and features to corresponding physical measures
               (e.g., strength) and ratings (e.g., attractiveness). METHODS:
               The association of handgrip strength (together with measures of
               shoulder width, body height, and body fat) and women's ratings
               of male faces (concerning dominance, masculinity, and
               attractiveness) were studied in a sample of 26 Caucasian men
               (aged 18-32 years). Geometric morphometrics was used to
               statistically assess the covariation of male facial shape with
               these measures. Statistical results were visualized with
               thin-plate spline deformation grids along with image unwarping
               and image averaging. RESULTS: Handgrip strength together with
               shoulder width, body fat, dominance, and masculinity loaded
               positively on the first dimension of covariation with facial
               shape (explaining 72.6\%, P < 0.05). These measures were related
               to rounder faces with wider eyebrows and a prominent jaw outline
               while highly attractive and taller men had longer, narrower jaws
               and wider/fuller lips. CONCLUSIONS: Male physical strength was
               more strongly associated with changes in face shape that relate
               to perceived masculinity and dominance than to attractiveness.
               Our study adds to the growing evidence that attractiveness and

  abstract = "One of the longest standing debates in the emotion sciences is
              whether emotions are represented as discrete categories such as
              happy or sad or as continuous fundamental dimensions such as
              valence and arousal. Theories of communication make specific
              predictions about the facial expression signals that would
              represent emotions as either discrete or dimensional messages.
              Here, we address this debate by testing whether facial
              expressions of emotion categories are embedded in a dimensional
              space of affective signals, leading to multiplexed communication
              of affective information. Using a data-driven method based on
              human perception, we modelled the facial expressions representing
              the six classic emotion categories -- happy, surprise, fear,
              disgust, anger and sad -- and those representing the dimensions
              of valence and arousal. We then evaluated their embedding by
              mapping and validating the facial expressions categories onto the
              valence-arousal space. Results showed that facial expressions of
              these six classic emotion categories formed dissociable clusters
              within the valence-arousal space, each located in semantically
              congruent regions (e.g., happy facial expressions distributed in
              positively valenced regions). Crucially, we further demonstrated
              the generalization of the embedding beyond the six classic
              categories, using a broader set of 19 complex emotion categories
              (e.g., delighted, fury, and terrified). Together, our results
              show that facial expressions of emotion categories comprise
              specific combinations of valence and arousal related face
              movements, suggesting a multiplexed signalling of categorical and
              dimensional affective information. Our results unite current

               gold standard of measuring emotional valence (Facial
               Electromyography, EMG) and arousal (Skin Conductance, SC). We
               recorded physiological and behavioral measurements of 43 healthy

               neutral scenes. When viewing pleasant pictures, FR Valence and

               unpleasant stimuli, that were distinguishable with EMG.
               Furthermore, FR Arousal values had a stronger correlation with

  abstract  = "As a highly social species, humans generate complex facial
               expressions to communicate a diverse range of emotions. Since
               Darwin's work, identifying among these complex patterns which
               are common across cultures and which are culture-specific has
               remained a central question in psychology, anthropology,
               philosophy, and more recently machine vision and social
               robotics. Classic approaches to addressing this question
               typically tested the cross-cultural recognition of theoretically
               motivated facial expressions representing 6 emotions, and
               reported universality. Yet, variable recognition accuracy across
               cultures suggests a narrower cross-cultural communication
               supported by sets of simpler expressive patterns embedded in
               more complex facial expressions. We explore this hypothesis by
               modeling the facial expressions of over 60 emotions across 2
               cultures, and segregating out the latent expressive patterns.
               Using a multidisciplinary approach, we first map the conceptual
               organization of a broad spectrum of emotion words by building
               semantic networks in 2 cultures. For each emotion word in each
               culture, we then model and validate its corresponding dynamic
               facial expression, producing over 60 culturally valid facial
               expression models. We then apply to the pooled models a
               multivariate data reduction technique, revealing 4 latent and
               culturally common facial expression patterns that each
               communicates specific combinations of valence, arousal, and
               dominance. We then reveal the face movements that accentuate
               each latent expressive pattern to create complex facial
               expressions. Our data questions the widely held view that 6
               facial expression patterns are universal, instead suggesting 4
               latent expressive patterns with direct implications for emotion
               communication, social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and
               social robotics. (PsycINFO Database Record",

  abstract  = "Understanding the degree to which human facial expressions
               co-vary with specific social contexts across cultures is central
               to the theory that emotions enable adaptive responses to
               important challenges and opportunities1-6. Concrete evidence
               linking social context to specific facial expressions is sparse
               and is largely based on survey-based approaches, which are often
               constrained by language and small sample sizes7-13. Here, by
               applying machine-learning methods to real-world, dynamic
               behaviour, we ascertain whether naturalistic social contexts
               (for example, weddings or sporting competitions) are associated
               with specific facial expressions14 across different cultures. In
               two experiments using deep neural networks, we examined the
               extent to which 16 types of facial expression occurred
               systematically in thousands of contexts in 6 million videos from
               144 countries. We found that each kind of facial expression had
               distinct associations with a set of contexts that were 70\%
               preserved across 12 world regions. Consistent with these
               associations, regions varied in how frequently different facial
               expressions were produced as a function of which contexts were
               most salient. Our results reveal fine-grained patterns in human
               facial expressions that are preserved across the modern world.",
