# Preface {-}

This is the `html` output of the University of Amsterdam PhD thesis template from the [`amsterdown` package](https://github.com/lcreteig/amsterdown). You can view access the `pdf` version(s) of the output from the toolbar above.

This section will only show in the `html` version. Here you can add some general info about your thesis that's typically included in the `pdf`. For example:

* who your supervisors were
* where the project was conducted
* the license the thesis is published under
* funding info
* an image of the cover of your thesis
* etc.

For these and other ideas, see what this section looks like in [my PhD thesis](https://lcreteig.github.io/thesis/) (and also check out the source file [here](https://github.com/lcreteig/thesis/blob/master/_00-preface.Rmd)).
